        WEEKEND CLASSES OVER 8 WEEKS

      <p className="add-bottom-em">
        At San Diego Code School we have restructured our 8 week Front End Web
        Dev program to operate on a new model of Mob Programming and blended
        learning. Rather than traditional classrooms with stressful deadlines
        and long lectures, from day one you will work as a team to tackle
        learning and communicating technically to solve real-world problems. Our
        format takes away much of the stress and allows you to collaborate like
        you will on the job. You’ll learn as a member of a community of
        like-minded craftsman in an immersive experience. It’s intense and
        difficult work, but we’ll support you every step of the way.
      </p>
      <p className="add-bottom-em">
        We hold classes on Saturdays and Sundays so that you can transition into
        coding. Our students have the flexibility to study at home or in class
        during the week. Students may choose to work part-time, but we don’t
        encourage students to attempt to work full time and take our program
        part-time. Our program requires a 30-40 hour per week commitment to get
        through all the material in 8 weeks and be ready for a new career in
        Front-End Web development.
      </p>
      <p className="add-bottom-em">
        We encourage beginners to apply and we are fully prepared to take you
        from step 1 to job-ready. If you need more time, you can stay another
        week or so to make sure you have properly learned all the content of the
        course.
      </p>
      <p className="add-bottom-em">
        We code together on the weekends and our lectures are available
        prerecorded so you can watch them whenever and wherever you want, and
        then get more in-person contact with the instructors during our Mob
        Programming coding sessions. Blended learning is more efficient and
        allows the student to control their learning more than the traditional
        route.
      </p>
      <p className="add-bottom-em">
        Finally, our primary focus is to prepare you for day 1 in your new
        career. Every part of what we’re teaching is directly related to getting
        your first developer job, helping you with the search process, and
        making sure you succeed. We work harder than anyone to get you into the
        software industry.
