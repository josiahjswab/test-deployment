He offered a lot of great insight throughout my time at school and as I got to know him over time, was able to see his passion for the craft, education space, and semicolon usage (among other things). I also like that Michael is opinionated but was willing to dialogue with me and others about our ideas while backing up his assertions with reason.",

      "Michael was an instructor at the code school that originally got me into software development and jump-started my career path. He is extremely knowledgeable and was able to answer any questions I brought to the table. Unlike others, he wouldn’t just guide you to the solution to your problem. Instead, he would respond with intelligent questions that would be able to lead you to your answer. This process has helped me tremendously with future problems and questions that I have had in a way that now I can ask myself those questions and ultimately lead myself to a solution.
